# RLF Linkage Analysis Tool - Project Progress Summary (Updated)

## Current Status (February 25, 2025)

Implementation of our mechanical linkage analysis tool with the following key components:

1. **Interactive 2D Visualization System**
   - Draggable pivot points with real-time coordinate display
   - Visual representation of the arm, cross-link, and air cylinder
   - Real-time geometry manipulation

2. **Basic Application Structure**
   - React-based frontend with modular component architecture
   - Initial state management system for geometry and analysis data
   - UI controls for cylinder extension simulation

3. **Interactive Simulation Framework**
   - Unified interactive interface (no strict mode separation)
   - Cylinder extension controls for real-time simulation
   - Immediate force calculation feedback
   - Force metrics display component

## Implementation Details

### Frontend Components
- **App.jsx**: Main application container with state management
- **LinkageVisualizer**: 2D visualization of the linkage system using SVG
- **Controls**: UI for simulation controls and cylinder adjustment
- **ForceDisplay**: Component to show calculated force metrics

### Calculation Logic
- Basic geometric calculations (distances, angles)
- Linkage position calculations based on cylinder stroke
- Force and mechanical advantage calculations

## Design Evolution

After testing, we've decided to pursue a more fluid, unified interaction model instead of strictly separated design and simulation modes. This approach allows users to:

- Continuously adjust the mechanism geometry and see immediate force feedback
- Manipulate the cylinder extension while simultaneously tweaking the design
- Experience a more intuitive, exploratory interface for mechanism optimization

This approach will require optimized calculations for real-time feedback but will provide a superior user experience.

## Upcoming Work

1. **Performance Optimization**
   - Refine client-side calculations for instant feedback
   - Implement calculation throttling for complex updates
   - Add optional design locking to prevent accidental changes

2. **Backend Integration**
   - Setting up Python FastAPI backend for complex calculations
   - Implementing WebSocket communication for real-time updates
   - Creating endpoints for advanced force analysis

3. **3D Analysis Visualization**
   - Implementing 3D surface plots using Plotly.js
   - Visualizing force vs. position relationships
   - Adding controls for viewing different analysis parameters

4. **Enhanced Simulation Features**
   - Real-time geometry updates during cylinder motion
   - Continuous force feedback during interaction
   - Support for various unit systems (inches and pounds)

5. **User Experience Improvements**
   - Adding measurements for distances between points
   - Implementing angle measurements for pivots and arms
   - Adding constraint validation
   - Creating presets for common configurations

## Technical Notes

- The application will use a hybrid calculation approach with:
  - JavaScript for immediate feedback and UI responsiveness
  - Python backend for complex 3D analysis and intensive calculations

- We're planning to implement unit handling in imperial units (inches and pounds) based on project requirements

- The 3D visualization will be powered by Plotly.js, with data generated by Python's scientific computing libraries

## Next Immediate Steps

1. Refine real-time calculations for the unified interface
2. Set up the Python backend structure
3. Implement WebSocket communication for continuous data exchange
4. Create the 3D visualization component that updates with geometry changes
