Current Status
We've successfully implemented:

    1. An interactive 2D visualization of the mechanical linkage system
    2. Draggable points and pivots with coordinate display
    3. Full design mode features (undo/redo, save/load, reset)
    4. Visual representation of the arm, cross-link, and air cylinder

Next Steps
1. Simulation Mode Implementation

    Add a mode toggle button (Design/Simulation)
    Implement cylinder movement controls (input for stroke distance)
    Calculate geometry changes when the cylinder moves
    Display forces and mechanical advantages

2. Backend Integration

    Set up the Python FastAPI backend
    Create WebSocket connection for real-time updates
    Port the force calculation logic from the Python script
    Send geometry data to backend and receive force analysis

3. 3D Analysis Visualization

    Implement 3D surface plots using Plotly.js
    Visualize force vs. position relationships
    Update 3D graphs in real-time as geometry changes
    Add controls for viewing different analysis parameters

4. Enhanced Features

    Add measurements for distances between points
    Calculate and display mechanical advantage
    Add angle measurements for pivots and arms
    Implement constraint validation

5. User Experience Improvements

    Add tooltips and help information
    Improve visual feedback during interaction
    Add presets for common configurations
    Add export options for analysis results

The most immediate step would be implementing the simulation mode to make the system functional for analysis, followed by connecting to the Python backend to perform the actual force calculations.
