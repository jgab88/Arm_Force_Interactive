RLF Linkage Analysis Tool - Project Progress Update (February 28, 2025)
Current Status
We've successfully implemented the backend integration for our mechanical linkage analysis tool with the following key achievements:

FastAPI Backend Integration

Implemented a robust Python backend with FastAPI
Created core analysis modules for force and geometry calculations
Developed both WebSocket and HTTP endpoints for flexibility
Added error handling and proper response formatting


Interactive Force Analysis

Implemented 3D visualization of force data using Plotly.js
Added real-time calculation of mechanical advantage and forces
Created a hybrid update system (auto/manual) for calculations
Optimized calculations to reduce unnecessary server requests


Stable Communication Architecture

Implemented HTTP-based communication as primary method
Added optional WebSocket support for real-time updates
Created a more reliable system with proper error handling
Improved user feedback during calculation processes


Enhanced User Experience

Added loading indicators during calculations
Implemented toggles for real-time updates and auto-calculation
Improved cross-browser compatibility
Reduced unnecessary re-renders for better performance



Technical Implementation Details

Backend

FastAPI server with Python 3.9+
NumPy/SciPy for vector calculations and analysis
CORS configuration for browser security
Dual communication protocols (WebSocket/HTTP)


Frontend

React with optimized component rendering
SVG for 2D visualization
Plotly.js for 3D force analysis visualization
Debounced calculations to prevent server overload


Data Flow

Client sends geometry and cylinder position data
Server performs force and mechanical advantage calculations
Server generates 3D surface data for visualization
Client renders analysis with multiple view options (3D surface, contour, heatmap)
